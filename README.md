## ⚙️ How it works

*TS5 Channel Image Generator* is fully client-side application built using React (Next.js). It uses Canvas API to work 
with images and 3rd party libraries to create ZIP files. Thanks to that no server is needed so **no images are 
uploaded/stored on the server**. App works in all modern browsers and support for image file formats is also 
dependent on supported file formats of given browser.
